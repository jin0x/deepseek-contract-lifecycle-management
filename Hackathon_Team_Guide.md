# Hackathon Team Guide

## 📋 Project Overview

We are building a **Contract Lifecycle Management System** leveraging **DeepSeek AI** for advanced contract analysis. The project will focus on automating key processes such as clause extraction, named entity recognition (NER), clause generation, and summarization. The goal is to create a functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that showcases the practical application of AI in contract management using an agentic workflow.

### Key Features:

- **Clause Extraction**: Identify and extract key contract clauses.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detect entities like dates, amounts, and legal references.
- **Clause Generation**: Suggest alternative or safer clause language.
- **Summarization**: Generate summaries of contracts for faster review.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Agno**: Agentic framework.
- **Chainlit**: For building the user interface and managing agentic workflows.
- **DeepSeek**: For AI-powered contract analysis.

### 🧑‍💻 Maryam – Data Preparation & Curation Lead

**Core Tasks:**

- Collect sample contracts (target: 20–30 contracts) and extract text using reliable PDF libraries.
- Clean and structure extracted text for input into DeepSeek.
  - Remove irrelevant content (e.g., scanned signatures, headers/footers).
  - Handle OCR and text formatting issues.
  - Organize extracted clauses into structured data (JSON).
- Work closely with Andreas to ensure data is ready for prompt engineering.
- Collaborate with Cynthia to define input/output format for visualizations.

**Collaboration:**

- Coordinate with John for data preparation guidance.
- Share cleaned and structured data with Andreas for prompt design and testing.

**Suggested Tools:**

- `PyPDF2`, pdfmin`er, `Textract`for PDF parsing;`pandas` for data structuring; Python for data cleaning.

### 🧑‍💻 Andreas – Core Prompt Engineer

**Core Tasks:**

- Design, test, and refine prompts for clause extraction, NER, clause generation, and summarization.
- Continuously iterate on prompts based on feedback from Maryam’s data and Chainlit outputs.
- Develop evaluation strategies for prompt outputs (simple validation checks for accuracy).
- Collaborate with Eman to ensure agent outputs are properly integrated in Chainlit.

**Collaboration:**

- Work closely with Maryam for clean and structured input data.
- Share prompt-engineered agents with Eman for Chainlit integration.

**Suggested Tools:**

- **DeepSeek**: Primary tool for executing clause extraction, NER, clause generation, and summarization.
- **OpenAI API or ChatGPT Interface**: For prompt design, testing, and refinement in a flexible environment before applying prompts to DeepSeek.
- **Chainlit**: For validating and testing prompt outputs within the agentic workflow.
- **Optional: OpenAI API (Auxiliary Validation)**: Used as an additional step for cross-checking and validating results manually.

### 🧑‍💻 Cynthia – Data Visualization & UI Specialist

**Core Tasks:**

- Create visualizations for agent outputs (e.g., clause distribution, NER heatmaps, summarization highlights).
- Build data dashboards in Chainlit to present results.
- Ensure the UI is intuitive and visually consistent with project goals.
- Collaborate with Maryam on input/output data format for visualization.

**Collaboration:**

- Work closely with Eman for integrating visualizations into the Chainlit UI.
- Coordinate with Maryam to ensure data is ready for visualization.

**Suggested Tools:**

- `Plotly`, `Altair`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn for visualizations; Chainlit for integration; Python for data manipulation.

## 🌐 Agentic Workflow Overview

We have designed a multi-agent system with the following core agents:

1. **Document Parsing Agent**
2. **Clause Extraction Agent**
3. **NER Agent (Named Entity Recognition)**
4. **Clause Generation Agent**
5. **Summarization Agent**
